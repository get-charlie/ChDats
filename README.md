# ChDats
Stb-style header libraries I made in C for common data structures.  
### How to use it in your project?
Using an stb-style library is very simple.  
1. Include the header file of the library you want to use in your source directory.  
2. In your header file add `#define IMPLEMENT_CHSTACK` to create the stack implementation.  
3. In your header file add `#include "chstack.h"`.  
4. That's it. All the library will be included in your .h file and you can use it easily.  
### Features
- Simple generic stacks with chstack.h  
- Simple generic queues with chqueue.h  
### Documentation
You can find additional documentation as comments in the code.
